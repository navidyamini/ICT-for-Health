# ICT-for-health
The objectives of this course are to use machine learning in public health applications, in particular in the areas of basic research,
prevention, diagnostic process, management of elderly people at home. The course is designed jointly with the course "Statistical Learning
nd Neural Networks", with the objective to provide students with a coordinated "machine learning" approach that can be applied to several 
ICT problems; in particular, "Statistical Learning and Neural Networks" deals primarily with machine learning in terms of classification 
and neural networks, while "ICT for health" addresses regression and clustering topics. Some classification techniques not analyzed in 
"Statistical Learning and Neural Networks" are analyzed in "ICT for health".
